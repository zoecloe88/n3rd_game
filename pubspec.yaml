# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at

# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see

  # Typography Configuration
  # 
  # **Production-Ready Font System:**
  # The app uses Google Fonts package (google_fonts: ^6.1.0) for dynamic font loading.
  # This is the recommended production approach as it:
  # - Ensures fonts are always up-to-date
  # - Reduces app bundle size
  # - Provides automatic fallback handling
  # - Works seamlessly online and offline (fonts are cached after first load)
  # 
  # **Font Families Used:**
  # - Playfair Display (headlines, display text)
  # - Lora (body text, serif)
  # - Inter (UI elements, labels)
  # 
  # **Optional: Bundled Fonts for Complete Offline Support**
  # If you prefer bundled fonts for guaranteed offline availability:
  # 1. Download font files from https://fonts.google.com/
  # 2. Create fonts/ directory in project root
  # 3. Place font files in fonts/ directory
  # 4. Uncomment the fonts section below
  # 
  # Note: Bundled fonts are optional - Google Fonts caching provides excellent
  # offline support after initial load, making bundled fonts unnecessary for most use cases.
