# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for the N3RD Game project.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records document important architectural decisions made during the development of the project. They capture:
- The context and problem being addressed
- The decision made
- The consequences (both positive and negative)
